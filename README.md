# To-Do-List
A JavaScript-based to-do list web application for managing tasks and organizing daily activities.

The JavaScript To-Do List project is a dynamic web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at assisting users in organizing tasks and managing their daily activities efficiently. The HTML structure forms the backbone of the application, defining the layout and structure of the to-do list interface, including elements such as input fields, buttons, and lists for displaying tasks.

CSS is utilized to enhance the visual presentation of the to-do list, offering styling options for elements such as font styles, colors, and layout, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. JavaScript serves as the driving force behind the application's functionality, enabling dynamic interaction with the to-do list interface.

Users can add new tasks by entering them into the input field and pressing a button, triggering JavaScript functions to create new list items dynamically. Additionally, functionalities such as marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and filtering tasks based on their status (e.g., completed, pending) are implemented using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation techniques.

The project fosters an understanding of JavaScript's role in building interactive web applications and provides a hands-on experience in implementing essential features for task management, making it a practical and educational exercise for web development enthusiasts.
